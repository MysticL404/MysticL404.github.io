  PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK TO THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS:
  1) <button> with the id of load-link on the loading page (index.html)
  2) <div> with the id of load-throbber on the loading page (index.html)
  3) <li> inside of the <ol> inside of the <nav> on the information page (hosono.html)
  4) <button> with the id of mode-button on the information page (hosono.html)
  5) switchModes() function - hint you can add a transition CSS property to the <body> and it will be inherited 
     by all the elements inside, so when custom CSS variables are changed it will apply transition

        Typically I'd use an <a> here but as we're faking a load time I'm using a <button> instead.  If it was an 
        <a> I would leave off the target attribute so that it would redirect the current tab.

      <!--
        The function loadPageAfterDelay() is declared in the file fakeLoad.js - it takes a number value that sets the 
        amount of time it takes in ms and a url to redirect to.
      -->

      <button id="load-link" onclick="loadPageAfterDelay(10000, './hosono.html')">Click to Load Page</button>
      <!-- Regarding this button and it's purpose, it essentially tells the user that the webpage is
      currently loading up, while this is false, it's effect works a lot better when paired up with transitions that slowly fade in
    or out of the page. This time can also give the CSS style more time to properly render and load. Otherwise it sort of wastes
  the users time so unless there is enough CSS style categories to justify the need for it, there won't be any need for it.
This can help as a way for webpages CSS to properly render as well as design a visually appealing webpage for it's users that's
easy to read and follow. -->




      <!--
        This is a div we're using for the throbber - if we wanted to do a % based loading bar there is an element 
        called <progress> but as this one is just indicating a wait rather than providing direct feedback on progress I've 
        opted for using a <div>.
      -->

      <div id="load-throbber"></div>
      <!-- The load-throbber id is what generates the opening loading bar as a way to tell the users that the webpage is loading up
      and generating. While it's helpful, this bar in particular doesn't actually tell the user how long it will take but instead
    just shows a blue bar that's either full or not. The inital button is to click on which is the device that starts the timer of
  the fake loading, it isn't a :hover but an :active that requires input to be activated. This is mainly just for appearances
although it can play an important role in keeping the user updated and not waiting for who knows how long, it could result in them
thinking the webpage is broken and not processing which can result in them just exiting it all together. -->
