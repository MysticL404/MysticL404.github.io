    <!-- Here, most of the coding comes into play. Initially I wanted to construct a button which randomised five images onto the screen although with
    lots of time and effort, I had no luck bringing it to life. I had an idea during the period which was to basically make a dream team making simulator.
    This would feature multiple buttons which the user could interact with and develop a dream team of five images/characters, whether it be the same
    character twice or three times was entirely up to the user, this would still retain the randomiser feature but add a twist instead of just clicking
    a single button throughout the whole time with no control of keeping one or two images they might've gotten.
    These buttons would have two functions connected to them being clicked, the first being the fading in animation so the user knows the input was actually
    successful in the situation they randomise the same image multiple times somehow. The second would be the randomiser itself, with an image_array of
    over 30 images, there are hundreds of potential dream teams the user can construct. I unfortunately needed to make 5 seperate functions for this since
    having just one would result in the same image appearing in all 5 slots everytime input was done on the button. -->

                </h4>

                <!-- Below is the flex-container that would home the images pulled from the image_array, this is done so all five image_showers are
                all next to each other in a line and the way the webpage is constructed ensures the user doesn't need to waste their time scrolling. -->
