  <!-- For starters, I wanted to create the link between the main interaction webpage and the randomiser webpage so I could go from one point to another
  without needing to open them up seperately all the time. Of course this would remain but size and location would be changed as things go forward.  -->
  <h2>

    <div class="flex-container-interaction">

      <!-- This is the main primary feature of the interaction page which lets the user hop to the randomiser webpage, this is also accompanied by a
      loading bar so the user is aware of how long they need to wait until it takes them to their destination. -->

    <!-- Below are the showcase shifting images which animate through a selection of images that of which the user can randomise and assemble.
    Ultimately, this is just added in to feature some feedback in a playful method which lets the users know what they can get.
    These images aren't randomised and shuffle in a loop consistently without change. -->

  <h3>
     <p>I initially had the idea of making the user interface simple enough so the user wouldn't need to waste time and jump
     straight into the randomiser so my specific design decision was to make the interaction and randomiser HTML's a single page with no scrolling needed.
     With the :root set with multiple variables, I experimented many unique colour palette choices that both HTML's could work with, originally starting with
     orange and ending with a strong light blue and dark blue design. The design I first had in mind when presenting the ideas was to create a playful
     feedback summoning simulator, in short, creating a randomiser that picks out an image from a variety of options randomly. I felt strong with the idea but
     I soon came to a roadblock which was figuring out how to make multiple random images appear at the same time and making them disappear at the same time
     when inputting the randomiser button once more. I brainstormed solutions and while the original idea
     had lots of feedback to offer, the playfulness didn't shine the way I wanted it to. Clicking
     a single button and not being in control was a boring and uncomfortable experience so I decided on making a simulator capable of making
     a dream team.</p>

     <p>Since I'm still new to javascript, <i><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_progressbar.asp">W3schools</a></i> would teach me the
     basics of coding a progress bar, a primary way of providing feedback to the user so they know their input did something and now know to wait still the
     progress bar hits 100%. Progress bars while functioning as feedback could also play the role of being playful as instead of just sitting there, the user
     actually has something to watch though this could be bias for the audience.</p>

     <p><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YjybCS4B2U">Melvin Adekanye</a></i> helped me learn about the image_array, the main focus of the 
    randomiser as it allows the buttons to randomly choose an image from the wide selection given. This is where the playfulness of the website comes in
    as some may want to create their dream team seriously or mess around with the webpage. Since there are 5 image_shower slots set, there are many potential outcomes and basically every
     user who may find themselves using it will have a different and unique outcome from their peers. This proved to be a much more playful experience overall.</p>

     <p>A unique design choice I wanted was inspired by mobile gacha games as well as the following link which helped me achieve designing it.
      <i><a href="https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-create-an-automatic-slideshow-with-html-css-and-js">Educative.io</a></i> was able to basically show me how I could create a
     slideshow between images. Many gacha games have something like this for their featured units or characters so I wanted to create something similar
     for the interaction page to give the users an idea on what there is to offer. There isn't much feedback here but the animations are enjoyable to watch.</p>

     <p>Lastly is arguably the most crucial add-on for feedback which is the animation played upon clicking the buttons. The obvious things like :hover and :active
     are implemented although an animation is required for when the images appear, a simple fade in animation is basically all that's required so the users
     are aware that the input worked in the situation they randomise the same image multiple times. <i><a href="https://www.delftstack.com/howto/javascript/javascript-fade-in-image/">Delftstack</a></i>
     was where I discovered how to javascript this into the webpage and like before, it would require me to make 5 seperate functions for each button.</p>

     <p>Originally whilst working on this assignment, I had a bunch of characters from offical games or movies but that has been changed to simple animal stock
      photos sourced from <i><a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a></i> for free to avoid any copyright issues.
