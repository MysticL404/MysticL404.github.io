    <b>Question 1: What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</b>
    <p>I found my attention when first interacting with the experience to be drawn towards the various tools available on the top 
        and left sides of the screen. Considering how the centre was just blank since the website was essentially for drawing, 
        my focus had been caught by the words and icons of tools that were sitting above and on the left. </p>
    </section>

    <section id="Q2">
        <b>Question 2: Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</b>
        <p>I drew some lines using my mouse holding left click on the page (15 seconds), I interacted with the File button 
            and pressed Import Image (5 seconds), I scrolled the size of the paint brush bigger (5 seconds), I drew bigger lines 
            using my mouse holding left click on the page (20 seconds), I clicked the eraser and held left click to remove drawn in 
            lines and imported image (10 seconds), I returned to Import Image and imported more images onto the website (50 seconds),
             I clicked a different paint style from the top right corner and drew bigger and smaller lines (20 seconds).</p>
            </section>

            <section id="Q3">
             <b>Question 3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</b>
             <p>When experiencing the Strike website, a large majority of the time spent was importing a bunch of my images 
                onto the website. At first I tested it once to see how it worked and after trying out other functions I came 
                back to it and spent close to a minute just importing all my images saved onto my laptop to see how they would 
                turn out with the black and white pattern styling.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="Q4">
                <b>Question 4: What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</b>
                <p>Like the previous question, I often found myself importing a bunch of images in curiosity to see how they would 
                    look in a completely altered format. In the 2 minutes spent, I would guess about 7 images were imported during 
                    the timespan of close to a minute. Something that comes close to that would be just drawing on the page using
                     regular lines.</p>

                    <section id="Q5">
                <b>Question 5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</b>
                <p>The primary intentional goal Strike has as a website is to allow people to paint using a unique format and set 
                    of tools compared to something like paint.exe. Many of the actions provided is a collection of items available
                     for the users so they may design something in black and white, things like a set of styles, size changer and 
                     the brushes shape all fuel for a creative imagination if they wish to design some personal or public fanart
                      or artwork.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="Q6">
                <b>Question 6: What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</b>
                <p>It’s clear that Strike’s primary source is heavily targeted towards unique artists of such given the set of 
                    tools and how the styles are presented. Since something like paint.exe currently exists, Strike would need
                     to shift things up and provide a drawing simulator with a different set of secondary tools like customised 
                     styles for painting whilst keeping the primary tools like size changing, erasers or the fill in bucket tool. 
                     It communicates this primary goal as such since there isn’t much else that can be performed apart from art, no 
                     one will try and write statistics on this website since it isn’t practical and nothing apart from drawing or
                      importing images can be performed within so that leaves it with few options, not to say those options are
                       bad but quite specifically designed for artists of some sort.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="Q7">
                <b>Question 7: What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? 
                    (For how long and how many different times)</b>
                <p>I believe the experience should be interacted similarly from how I did things originally,
                     that includes importing a few images to view how different the images can turn out with the
                      provided tools though I believe more time ought to be given to using the styles normally instead of just
                       importing for a full minute. Try and paint something original or maybe import an image and alter it with 
                       some extra lines and cosmetics. Some of the time should be used to understand the user interfaces tools 
                       and majority should be used just painting while lastly importing some images. (30 seconds, 1 minute, 30
                        seconds respectfully).</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="Q8">
                <b>Question 8: What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with 
                    over time?</b>
                <p>From what the interactive experience communicates, it wishes to be used for longer periods since art is
                     something that cannot be rushed, many features also support this like the ability to export and import images which works as 
                     the users saving point and the unique styles given would take lots of time practising and testing out. There is also the addition
                      of being about to rub out any little mistakes instead of just erasing the whole thing together like what a memory board would 
                      force upon users. Since its designed this way, much more time ought to be used, instead of 2 minutes, some could see use
                       with this website possibly for hours or even days depending on how attached they may grow though since the tools while 
                       are cool and impressive, there isn’t a crazy amount of variety to be had. Some may grow bored of using the
                        limited set of tools and move towards a software with more possibilities given.</p>

                    <section id="Q9">
                <b>Question 9: What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</b>
                <p>The experience references all sorts of media forms, whether it be digital or not. I can be the structure
                     of designing still images, it can express photography for artists or those who wish to draw something 
                     for entertainment purposes.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="Q10">
                <b>Question 10: What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging 
                    with it?</b>
                <p>It suggests and inspires creativity in a unique format, to try something new and experiment with the various 
                    possibilities it provides for the user. A fair number of styles exist when drawing on this website so when 
                    engaging with it, we shouldn’t think too deeply about what to draw and instead just go with our instincts.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="Q11">
                <b>Question 11: What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with 
                    it?</b>
                <p>As a user, we ought to feel freedom and creativity during the use of this website, so many outcomes 
                    and results exist with what we draw onto the page set for us. The feeling of freedom expresses itself through
                     how there are no restrictions as to what the user may like to draw, and the different styles allow for an 
                     infinite number of possibilities as to what one can draw with the website. Creativity functions the
                      same way though it gives this feeling of joy towards the ideas one may have to draw.</p>

                <b>Question 12: What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</b>
                <p>Potentially the interface’s colour I found to be quite dull to stare at. While I had no problem with the 
                    drawing materials being only shades of black and white, looking around the interface it had the same colour
                     which I found frustrating in a depressive way.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="Q13">
                <b>Question 13: What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</b>
                <p>The most satisfying element for this website would be the spacing of everything. All the main tools 
                    have their own sections which I found helpful in recognising where everything was quite quickly.</p>
